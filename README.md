# nvim-workbench
A workbench plugin inspired by Obsidian Workbench with some tweak.

## Disclaimer

This is my very first neovim plugin and also my first time coding in Lua. So, **use this at your own risk :)**

## Background

I have built this plugin specifically to fit with my personal workflow. For every features or tasks that I am working on,
I always love to break them down into details. Before this, I was using Obsidian workbench, until I started following
[ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) and [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries/). I have watched many of their
YouTube videos and also their streams on Twitch and I have learned some much from them and the community. In the end, I was inspired
to try and built my own plugin. There's no better way to start than building something that I will use everyday. I am super motivated
to build this so that I don't have to keep switching desktop to look at my task again, I can just pop up a floating video in Neovim!
Of course, there are many task management plugins out there, [vim-bujo](https://github.com/vuciv/vim-bujo) is the one that inspired
me to built something similar with my personal tweak. So, let's get started!

## What this plugin does?

1. It provides a specific workbench for all your projects (currently only support project with Git initialized)
2. You can do anything inside the workbench, for me, I love to write down all the tasks I needed to do for a feature request or bug fix.
3. Below is a simple GIF showing how you can use this plugin.
